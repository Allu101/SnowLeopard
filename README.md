# UnrealPower
An Advanced Machine Learning Cheat Detection based on Nova41's anticheat, but even more advanced with more features and pre-trained samples, so everything can work perfectly without any training.

# Difference
Nova41's anticheat supports only MachineLearning, without auto-checking and autoban. We're planning to add more checks, antiesp, movement checks and much more!

# Machine-Learning
All pre-trained machine-learning data are in categories folder. You can use them on your server as long as you like. They are trained by our experts and working pretty good. They already detects following mods

* Flux KillAura (behavior.Combined)
* Flux AimAssist (behavior.Combined | behavior.Skid)
* Flux LegitAura (behavior.Combined | behavior.Skid)
* WURST KillAura & LegitAura (behavior.Combined)
* Skid KillAura AAC, hypixel, normal, rewi & others (behavior.Combined | behavior.Skid)
* Envy KillAura (behavior.Combined, we're planning to add separated pattern for this client in other to make better detection)
* Aristois (behavior.Combined, we're planning to add separated pattern for this client in other to make better detection)
* And pretty much every other killaura and some aimbots and aimassists
